# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Classifier (Deep Learning)

This is my **first deep learning project** — a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using **TensorFlow & Keras** to classify tomato leaf images into multiple disease categories.

## 📌 Project Overview
Early detection of plant diseases is crucial to reduce crop loss and ensure healthy yields.  
This model can detect **10 classes** of tomato leaf conditions (healthy + various diseases) from images.

## 🚀 Features
- Image preprocessing & augmentation
- CNN model built from scratch
- 90%+ validation accuracy
- Can test on custom images
- Ready for deployment (Flask / Streamlit)

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset used is from the **PlantVillage** dataset, containing:
- **16002 images**
- **10 classes** of tomato leaf health/diseases
